 * SELECT_ACTION_TARGET Handler
 *
 * Flow:
 * 1. Player has chosen to use a card action (via USE_CARD_ACTION)
 * 2. Now selecting which card/player to target
 * 3. Add target to pending action's targets array
 * 4. Execute card-specific logic based on card rank:
 *    - Jack (J): Blind swap 2 cards from 2 different players (needs 2 targets)
 *    - Queen (Q): Peek 2 cards from 2 different players, then optionally swap
 *    - 7/8: Peek own card (1 target, confirm needed)
 *    - 9/10: Peek opponent card (1 target, confirm needed)
 *    - Ace (A): Force opponent to draw (1 target)
 *
 * Note: King (K) has its own dedicated handler
