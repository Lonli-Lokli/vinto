# Vinto Bot

This package implements the AI bot logic for the Vinto card game. Its main responsibilities are:

- Providing automated player (bot) behavior for local and online games.
- Making decisions for bot-controlled players, including card selection, action usage, and strategy.
- Integrating with the Vinto game engine to simulate human-like gameplay.
- Supporting different difficulty levels and strategies for bots.
- Ensuring bots follow all game rules and phases, including special actions and toss-in logic.
- Exposing a simple interface for the main app/game client to create and control bots.

## Usage

This package is intended to be used as part of the main Vinto application. It is not a standalone game, but a library for bot player logic.

## Development

- Bot logic is implemented in TypeScript.
- Tests should cover all major decision branches and edge cases.
- See the main Vinto repo for integration details.
